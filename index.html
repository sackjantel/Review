            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> I started my education in Vancouver, Washington. After graduating from the Columbia River IB Program I enrolled in <span style="color: blue;">Boise</span> <span style="color: orange;">State</span> University as a marketing major. What brings me to programming is undoubtedly my intrigue in creating. I have always had a fascination for how computers work.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/sackjantel/travel-site">Travel Site</a></h2>
            <p>In this project we used basic html to create a page about popular travel destinations. It was fun to start my programming with a site like this because I had just got back from a 2 month backpacking trip through Europe</p>

            <p>This was my <strong>baptism</strong> into the coding world. Another basic html site that was intended to build basic principles in our own personal coding platform</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/sackjantel/my-first-webpage/blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">My First Webpage</a></h2>
            <p>As can be assumed from the title, this was the first time I had input code and watched it develop in front of me. It was a fun experience to start my programming adventure</p>
